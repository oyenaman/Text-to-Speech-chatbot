# Text-to-Speech-chatbot
This chatbot is made using the Edge-TTS which is entirely free to use and has multiple voices. 
when you clone this repository, make sure to make a 'text' and an 'audio' folder.
The 'text' folder will hace your text files and the 'audio' folder will contain the generated audio files after you run the backend.
